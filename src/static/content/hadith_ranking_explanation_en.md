## Explanation of Hadith Ranks

Praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his companions, and those who follow his guidance. As to what follows:

The science of Hadith is one of the noblest and most esteemed sciences. Through it, the accepted narrations are distinguished from the rejected ones among the sayings of the Master of Messengers, peace and blessings be upon him. The ranks of Hadith vary according to different considerations. One of the most important of these considerations is the status of the Hadith in terms of its acceptability or rejection, which is crucial for a Muslim to know what can be validly used as evidence and what cannot.

### Classification of Hadith by Acceptability and Rejection

From this perspective, Hadith is divided into two main categories: Maqbool (Accepted) and Mardood (Rejected).

**Al-Hadith Al-Maqbool (The Accepted Hadith):** This is a Hadith that has fulfilled the conditions of acceptance established by Hadith scholars, and therefore, it is suitable for use as proof and for acting upon its content. The Accepted Hadith is further divided into two primary ranks:

1.  **Sahih (Authentic):** This is the highest rank of accepted Hadith. For a Hadith to be Sahih, it must meet five fundamental conditions: continuity of the chain of narrators (Isnad), the integrity ('Adalah) of all narrators, the precision (Dabt) of all narrators (whether in memory or in writing), freedom from any irregularity (Shudhudh), and freedom from any disqualifying hidden defect ('Illah Qadihah). A Sahih Hadith is an authoritative proof that must be acted upon, according to the consensus of reputable scholars.

2.  **Hasan (Good):** This is the second rank of accepted Hadith. A Hasan Hadith is similar to a Sahih Hadith in most of its conditions, except that there might be a narrator in its chain who is of a lesser degree of precision than the narrators of a Sahih Hadith, while still being of good character and not known for anything that would cause his narration to be rejected. Like the Sahih Hadith, the Hasan Hadith is used as proof, although it is of a lesser strength.

Scholars of Hadith may sometimes use other synonymous terms for a Hasan Hadith, such as "Jayyid" (good) or "Isnaduhu Salih" (its chain is sound).

**Al-Hadith Al-Mardood (The Rejected Hadith):** This is a Hadith that has failed to meet one or more of the conditions of acceptance, and therefore, it is not suitable for use as proof. The most well-known type of rejected Hadith is the Da'if Hadith.

1.  **Da'if (Weak):** This term applies to any Hadith that does not meet the criteria of a Sahih or Hasan Hadith. The reasons for the weakness of a Hadith are numerous and varied. Some relate to the chain of narration, such as a break in the chain or an unknown narrator. Others relate to the narrator himself, such as having a poor memory, being accused of lying, or being an innovator (in religious matters). A Da'if Hadith is not used as proof in legal rulings or matters of creed. However, some scholars may be lenient in narrating and acting upon it in matters of فضائل الأعمال (virtues of deeds) under specific conditions.

2.  **Mawdu' (Fabricated):** This is the worst type of weak Hadith; in reality, it is not a Hadith at all but rather a lie deliberately invented and attributed to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. Narrating a Mawdu' Hadith is forbidden by the consensus of Muslims for anyone who knows its status, except to expose its fabricated nature and warn against it.

Hadith scholars may also use other terms to indicate the severity of a Hadith's weakness, such as "Batil" (false), "La Asla Lahu" (it has no basis), "Isnaduhu Talif" (its chain is ruined), or "Munkar" (denounced) if a weak narrator uniquely reports something that contradicts reliable narrators.

### Other Terminologies

You may encounter other terms used by Hadith scholars when judging Hadiths, such as Imam At-Tirmidhi's statement: "Hadith Hasan Gharib." His saying "Hasan" indicates the Hadith's rank in terms of acceptability. As for his saying "Gharib" (strange/scarce), it describes the Hadith as being Ahad, meaning it was narrated by only one narrator at some level of the chain of transmission. It might be Gharib through a specific chain while having other chains. Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "When At-Tirmidhi says: Hasan Gharib, he may mean that it is Gharib from that particular chain, but the text (Matn) has other supporting narrations (Shawahid) by which it became classified as Hasan."

Understanding these ranks and terminologies helps a Muslim comprehend the statements of scholars and distinguish what can be correctly attributed to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, from what cannot. This is essential for anyone who studies or transmits the Prophetic Sunnah.

We ask Allah to grant us beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds, and to give us understanding in our religion. And praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
